<h1>Hi Jay, This is Leadership CSS</h1>
<p>10 powerful quotes on making your own way</p>
<p>A great leader knows how to translate vision into reality, even when one person’s vision seems like a dream. Here are 10 powerful quotes on striking your own path:</p><br>
<P>"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower."
    -Steve Jobs, Apple co-founder</P> <br>
    <p>"Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."
    -Ralph Waldo Emerson</p><br>
    <p>"The true mark of a leader is the willingness to stick with a bold course of action — an unconventional business strategy, a unique product-development roadmap, a controversial marketing campaign — even as the rest of the world wonders why you're not marching in step with the status quo.
         In other words, real leaders are happy to zig while others zag. They understand that in an era of hyper-competition and non-stop disruption, the only way to stand out from the crowd is to stand for something special." Bill Taylor</P>
